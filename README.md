# Messi vs Ronaldo - Tic Tac Toe

This is a visual studio 2022 project. NOT VSCODE.  

https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/#vs-section  

## Project Configuration

Both release and debug x64 configurations will build the executable in the root folder of the project. This will automatically give the built executable access to the pictures in the data folder if you run the executable outside of the IDE.  

## About the game

The game is for two players, and I have successfully entertained children with it for a few minutes.  

## Linux

Use the makefile providing that mingw64 bit is installed. I wont be including the three dll's needed that will come with the compiler - you will find them in the bin subfolder of the compiler.  

You must also use the linux branch because the rc files have different formats.
