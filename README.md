# Messi vs Ronaldo - Tic Tac Toe

This is a visual studio 2022 project. NOT VSCODE.  

https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/#vs-section  

## Project Configuration

Both release and debug x64 configurations will build the executable in the root folder of the project. This will automatically give the built executable access to the pictures in the data folder if you run the executable outside of the IDE.  

## About the game

The game is for two players, and I have successfully entertained children with it for a few minutes.  

## Linux

Use the makefile and change the CC flag within to reflect the compiler you have installed. You will also need some dll's if you want to run the file on windows and if you want to run it natively on wine linux you can do the same.
