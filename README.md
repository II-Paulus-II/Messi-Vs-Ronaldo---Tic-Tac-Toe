# Messi vs Ronaldo - Tic Tac Toe

This is a visual studio 2022 project. NOT VSCODE.  

https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/#vs-section  

## Project Configuration

Both release and debug x64 configurations will build the executable in the root folder of the project. This will automatically give the built executable access to the pictures in the data folder if you run the executable outside of the IDE.  

## About the game

The game is for two players, and I have successfully entertained children with it for a few minutes.  

## Linux

I have successfully used wine in linux to run programs that I have compiled there but this is the first time I have used GDI+ so I have yet to try. I suspect its not that hard, but if you want to cross-compile I have had problems cross-compiling in some distributions. [Basically Ubuntu]. If I add a makefile later, I will only be testing it in arch.
